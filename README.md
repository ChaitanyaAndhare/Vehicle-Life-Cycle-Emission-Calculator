# "EcoWheel" Vehicle-Life-Cycle-Emission-Calculator
This is EcoWheel, a Vehicle LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) calculator which aims to aware users of their carbon footprint and encourage them to switch to better vehicle engine based on their usage. It is made with the sole purpose to reduce air pollution in tier 1,2 cities. It is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript leveraging Chart.js. 

The Calculator: 
 • Shows accurate Cradle to Grave emissions through Visual Outputs.
 • Compares the emissions released in a trip to total lifespan emissions.
 • Gives information in a more familiar way using “Tree Equivalent”.
 • Simultaneously compares every Vehicle Technology’s Total CO₂ Equivalent

 Inputs :
 1. Vehicle Type
 2. Mileage(Km/l or Km/KWh)
 3.  Total distance driven (Km)

 Outputs :
 1. % Lifespan Emissions Ring
 2. Net Emissions Breakdown
 3. Tree Equivalent
 4. Emissions Profile Over Distance
 5. Technology Comparison
 6. Operational Emissions Comparison

 The Applications:
 1. Provides data for policymakers to develop regulations and incentives for promoting eco-friendly vehicle technologies.
 2. Supports automotive manufacturers and researchers in optimizing vehicle designs for better environmental performance by understanding the life cycle emissions 
    and energy use.
 3. Enables analysis of the long-term cost-effectiveness of different vehicle options.
 4. Helps assess the carbon footprint and overall environmental impact of different vehicle
    technologies, aiding in sustainable decision-making.
